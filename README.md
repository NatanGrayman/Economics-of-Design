# Project Title: Economic Viability of Solar Panels vs. Generators for High Load GPU Bitcoin Mining in South Africa

## Project Overview

This project evaluates the economic viability of implementing solar panels versus generators for a high load GPU Bitcoin mining corporation, Cryptohub (Pty) Ltd, based in South Africa. The analysis incorporates financial analysis, microeconomic, and macroeconomic perspectives to determine the most cost-effective and sustainable energy solution.

### Distinction and Recognition

The project received a distinction and was supported by my previous experience in accounting, highlighted by my achievement of placing in the top 10 of a national accounting Olympiad in Grade 12.

## Objectives

1. **Evaluate the initial and ongoing costs** of implementing solar panels versus generators.
2. **Analyze the return on investment (ROI)** and payback period for both energy solutions.
3. **Assess the environmental impact** and long-term sustainability of each option.
4. **Incorporate microeconomic factors** such as cost of materials, labor, and maintenance.
5. **Consider macroeconomic factors** such as government policies, subsidies, and economic conditions in South Africa.

## Methodology

1. **Data Collection**: Gathered data on the cost of solar panels and generators, including installation, maintenance, and operational costs.
2. **Financial Analysis**: Conducted a detailed financial analysis using net present value (NPV), internal rate of return (IRR), and payback period calculations.
3. **Microeconomic Analysis**: Evaluated the impact of supply and demand for energy resources, cost of materials, and labor market conditions.
4. **Macroeconomic Analysis**: Analyzed government policies, subsidies for renewable energy, economic stability, and inflation rates in South Africa.
5. **Environmental Impact Assessment**: Compared the carbon footprint and sustainability of solar panels versus generators.

## Key Findings:

### Solar System

- **Cost Savings**: Solar power can reduce electricity costs during non-load-shedding periods, saving R607,919.90 per year.
- **Net Cash Flow**: The net cash flow for the first year is R2,457,920, steadily increasing each year.
- **Payback Period**: The initial investment can be recouped in 3 years.
- **NPV**: The net present value is R476,289, indicating profitability.
- **IRR**: The internal rate of return is 19%, exceeding the required rate of return of 16.5%.

### Generator System

- **Cost Savings**: No additional electricity cost savings during non-load-shedding periods.
- **Net Cash Flow**: The net cash flow for each year is R1,800,000.
- **Payback Period**: The initial investment can be recovered in 3.33 years.
- **NPV**: The net present value is -R174,364, indicating unprofitability.
- **IRR**: The internal rate of return is 15%, below the required rate of return of 16.5%.

## Financing

- **Structured Loan Agreement**: To finance the purchase without diluting shareholder equity.
- **Liquidity and Solvency**: The business is solvent but has liquidity concerns, which can be managed with a structured loan over a 5-year period.

## Conclusions

- **Solar System**: Recommended due to higher net cash flow, shorter payback period, positive NPV, and higher IRR. It is also more environmentally and socially sustainable.
- **Financing**: A 5-year loan repayment plan is recommended to improve cash liquidity and match the 5-year forecast.
